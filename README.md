# DocumentStore

Data Structures course project (Spring 2019):
• Developed an application that takes document files, compresses and stores them in memory.
• Programmed to keep a dictionary lookup which maps words to all documents containing that word. 
• User can define a limit of how many documents can be stored in memory, if the limit is reached the least used document is stored on the disk in JSON format. 
• System tracks additions to the application chronologically. Able to undo any operation in the application. 

The project was done in 5 stages over the course of the semester, the final stage can be found in DocumentStore/stage5
